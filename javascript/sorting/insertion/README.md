# insertion Sort

This algorithm takes in an array and sorts each value inplace.

This function takes in an array and we use a for loop to iterate through the array to check the current value and its previous value. We do this until we each the end of our array and we have a sorted array.

## Algorithm

create a function that takes in a sorted array of integer.

we would then initialize 'i' to '0'
and create a while loop that will run as long as the 'value' is greater than the current index of the input array.
we would then set
